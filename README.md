## The Future of AI in Software Development
[JetBrains Article](https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2025/07/the-future-of-ai-in-software-development/)

## Summary
This article takes the AI hype up to a new level, emphasizing how tools and programming languages themselves will need to be entirely revolutionized as AI adoption increases. One example is the IDE: while today's IDEs are designed to be approachable and usable by humans, the article argues that future IDEs will start catering more to machine users than humans. So, instead of using existing AI-enabled IDEs like Cursor or Copilot as "assistants," new IDEs will be more like **"orchestration platforms"** where human developers refine and verify AI work rather than write their own code. As a Senior in college studying Computer Science, this future is both intimidating and full of new opportunities, and this article only reinforces my belief that in order to be a successful engineer in the future I must be ready and willing to see AI as a partner or teammate rather than just a simple tool. 

## Matthew Membreno's comment
Your insight about IDEs shifting from "assistants" to "orchestration platforms" captures how fundamental this transformation could be. It's not just about better autocomplete, but potentially reimagining the entire developer workflow around human-AI collaboration. The article's two scenarios also highlight an important strategic choice for developers: whether to prepare for managing AI teammates or potentially being managed by them.
